Hello, my actual first name is **Jakub** and I'm a Python developer from
Prague/[Karlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl√≠n). Prior to my career in
IT, I've spent most of my life competing professionally in
[Judo](https://www.ijf.org/judoka/9329) which has given me a lifetime of
memories and many good friends. I have strong passion for various things but
here are some topics that I currently engage with the most:

 - Health and well-being
 - Digital privacy and free software
 - Unix text editors
 - Personal development and growth

## Projects
Here are some projects I'm occasionally working on:
