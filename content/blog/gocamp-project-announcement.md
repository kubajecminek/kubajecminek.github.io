My small hobby project is now live. It is simple e-commerce platform where you can book a place at the judo camp (NGO run by my brother :star:) and buy merchandise - https://shop.judoheroes.cz. It is written in **Go**, and I've made an effort to utilize the standard library as much as possible. The website features sessions, dynamic form generation and form validation, and more. It utilizes BigQuery as the backend database for storing orders data, eliminating the need for any additional infrastructure. The entire configuration is handled through a JSON file.
