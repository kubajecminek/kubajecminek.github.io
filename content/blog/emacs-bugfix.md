Today is a very special day for me :tada:. I have made my first contribution to an important free/libre software project. The fact that I fixed a bug in Emacs, my favorite text editor, that had been there for 11 years is the cherry on top :heart:. If you encounter any troubles with the *orgtbl-to-table.el* function in the next Emacs release, you know who to blame :smile:.
