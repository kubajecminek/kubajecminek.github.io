Hello :wave:, my name is **Jakub Ječmínek** and I'm a data engineer from Prague/[Karlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlín). Prior to my career in IT, I've spent most of my life competing professionally in [Judo](/posts/my-judo-stats), which gave me amazing memories that I will cherish forever :sparkling_heart:. I have strong passion for various things but here are some topics that I engage with:
 - Health and well-being
 - Digital privacy and free software
 - Unix text editors
 - Personal development and growth
